Improvements:
- Add more gateway tests, to test different nil fields;
- Test all the functions used in the managers;
- Test the presenter;
- UI tests;
- Refactor constraints so that the app mantains the same aspect in different screens;
- Fix constraint problems -> Top view is way too big and I can't change the height;
- Show an empty screen message when the filters don't work;

Thank you for giving me this challenge ðŸ™‚ this was very challenging for me, I hope to receive more feedback from you on how to improve.

Note: I noticed during this challenge that I don't know how to write wikipidea ðŸ˜­ if you notice the typos about this word let me know so I can fix it.
